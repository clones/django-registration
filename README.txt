===================
Django Registration
===================

This is a fairly simple user-registration application for Django_,
designed to make allowing user signups as painless as possible. It
requires a recent Subversion checkout of Django, since it uses
newforms and a couple other post-0.95 additions. Aside from that, it
has no external dependencies.


Installation notes
==================

Google Code recommends doing the Subversion checkout like so::

    svn checkout http://django-registration.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ django-registration

But the hyphen in the application name can cause issues installing
into a DB, so it's really better to do this::

    svn checkout http://django-registration.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ registration

If you've already downloaded, rename the directory before installing.

Then just add ``registration`` to the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting of
your project, and you should be good to go.

Note that one of the templates included with this app uses the
``humanize`` library, so you'll want to have
``django.contrib.humanize`` installed if you don't already.


The short and sweet instructions
================================

Here's the workflow for user signup:

1. User signs up for account.
2. User gets emailed an activation link.
3. User clicks the activation link before it expires.
4. User becomes a happy and productive contributor to your site.

To make this work, start by putting this app into your
``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting and running ``syncdb``. Then, add a new
setting in your settings file: ``ACCOUNT_ACTIVATION_DAYS``. This
should be a number, and will be used as the number of days before an
activation key expires.

Next, either edit the included templates (see below) to suit your
site, or create your own templates which integrate with your site's
look and feel.

Finally, drop this line into your root URLConf::

    (r'^accounts/', include('registration.urls')),

And point people at the URL ``/accounts/register/``. Things should
just work.


If emails never get sent
========================

Welcome to the world of spam filtering! Assuming your server settings
are correct and Django is otherwise able to send email, the most
likely problem is overzealous filtering on the receiving end. Many
spam filtering solutions are depressingly overactive and love to eat
account-registration emails.

If you know how to solve this, you will make millions of dollars.


How it works under the hood
===========================

This app defines one model -- ``RegistrationProfile`` -- which is tied
to the ``User`` model via a unique foreign key (so there can only ever
be one ``RegistrationProfile`` per ``User``), and which stores an
activation key and the date/time the key was generated.

There's a custom manager on ``RegistrationProfile`` which has two
important methods:

1. ``create_inactive_user`` takes a username, email address and
   password, and first creates a new ``User``, setting the
   ``is_active`` field to ``False``. Then it generates an activation
   key and creates a ``RegistrationProfile`` for that
   ``User``. Finally, it sends an email to the new user with an
   activation link to click on.
2. ``activate_user`` takes an activation key, looks up the
   ``RegistrationProfile`` it goes with, and sets ``is_active`` to
   ``True`` on the corresponding ``User``.

The views and form defined in this app basically exist solely to
expose this functionality over the Web. The registration form, used in
the initial sign-up view, does a little checking to make sure that the
username isn't taken and that the user types a password twice without
typos, but once that validation is taken care of everything gets
handed off to ``RegistrationProfile.objects.create_inactive_user``.

Similarly, the activation view doesn't do a whole lot other than call
``RegistrationProfile.objects.activate_user``.


Clearing out inactive accounts
==============================

Since activation keys do eventually expire (after however many days
you've specified in the ``ACCOUNT_ACTIVATION_DAYS`` setting), there's
a possibility that you'll end up with people who signed up but never
activated their accounts. And that's bad, because it clutters up your
database and it keeps the username they signed up with from ever
actually being used.

So there's also a third method defined on ``RegistrationProfile``'s
custom manager: ``delete_expired_users``. All it does is loop through
the DB, looking for inactive accounts with expired activation keys,
and deletes them. It's recommended that you run it every once in a
while (ideally, just set up a cron job to do it periodically) so you
can clear out any inactive accounts and free up those usernames.

The only time this isn't desirable is when you use the ``is_active``
field as a way to keep troublesome users under control -- when you set
``is_active`` to ``False``, they can't log in, which is pretty
handy. But that means you _want_ to have an inactive account in your
DB and you *don't* want ``delete_expired_users`` to delete it -- if
that happened, the troublemaker could just re-create the account and
start all over again.

For this reason, ``delete_expired_users`` looks first at the
``RegistrationProfile`` table, and only goes into the ``User`` table
when it finds expired profiles. So to keep a ``User`` around and
permanently inactive, just manually delete their
``RegistrationProfile`` instance and ``delete_inactive_users`` will
never touch their account.


A note on templates
===================

The download includes a set of example templates to give you an idea
of how to use the app, but please note that they are **examples** and
almost certainly will not work "out of the box" with your site; the
example templates are copied directly from a site which uses this
application, which means that they include assumptions about the
existence of that site's base templates and page structure. If you try
to use them as-is, you will most likely receive errors about
"base.html" not existing, or run into a mismatch between the blocks
defined in your site's base template and the blocks used in the
example templates.

**As a result, it is assumed that you will look at, and edit, the
included templates before trying to use them on your own site**. If
you like, you can copy them into your site's template directory and
edit them there, or edit them in-place; Django's "app directories"
template loader, which is active by default, will be able to find them
if you do so.

If you're unsure of how to work with Django templates, consult `the
Django template documentation`_.

The included template for activation emails requires the ``humanize``
library, so if you use it as-is, be sure to add
``django.contrib.humanize`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.

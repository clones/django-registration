django-registration changelog
=============================


Version 0.2, 29 May 2007:
-------------------------

Packaged from revision 73 in Subversion; download at
http://django-registration.googlecode.com/files/registration-0.2.tar.gz

* Added ability to specify a callback in
  ``RegistrationManager.create_inactive_user`` or in the ``register``
  view to enable creation of site-specific user profile.

* Separated out the logic of creating the profile into a new method on
  ``RegistrationManager``: ``create_profile``.

* Added URLConf support for various useful views in
  ``django.contrib.auth``.

* BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: removed the ``key_generated`` field
  from ``RegistrationProfile``; activation key expiration is now
  calculated based on the ``date_joined`` field in the ``User`` model.
  Drop the ``key_generated`` column from your database when upgrading
  from 0.1.

-------------------------

Packaged from revision 56 in Subversion; download at
http://django-registration.googlecode.com/files/registration-0.1.tar.gz

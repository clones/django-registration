django-registration changelog
=============================


Version 0.3p5, 6 October 2007:
----------------------------

* Packaged from revision 111 in Subversion.

* Added German translation.

* Fixed a mismatch between the default ``RegistrationForm``'s maximum
  length on email addresses and the actual maximum length on Django's
  ``User`` model.

* Fixed a situation where bad input for the ``password1`` field on
  ``RegistrationForm`` could cause validation of ``password2`` to fail
  with an exception.


Version 0.3p4, 4 October 2007:
------------------------------

* Packaged from revision 101 in Subversion.

* BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: In response to larger numbers of
  complaints from people trying to use the example templates as-is,
  the example templates have been removed.


Version 0.3p2, 23 September 2007:
---------------------------------

* Packaged from revision 100 in Subversion.

* Fixed ``activate`` view to actually take the ``template_name``
  argument.


Version 0.3p1, 22 September 2007:
---------------------------------

* Packaged from revision 99 in Subversion.

* Fixed a typo in docs/overview.txt.

Version 0.3, 19 September 2007:
-------------------------------

Packaged from revision 89 in Subversion; download at
http://django-registration.googlecode.com/files/registration-0.3.tar.gz

* Changed ``register`` and ``activate`` views to accept
  ``template_name`` keyword argument for selecting a custom template.

* Changed ``register`` view to accept ``form_class`` keyword
  argument specifying the form to use.

* BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Changed
  ``RegistrationManager.create_inactive_user`` to use a template for
  the subject of the activation email.

* BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Removed the ``tos`` field from
  ``RegistrationForm``; if you were relying on it, switch to using
  ``RegistrationFormTermsOfService`` instead.

* BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The activation email template now
  receives the current ``Site`` object as the context variable
  ``site``, and the ``current_site`` variable, which only held the
  domain, is no longer available.

* Added script ``bin/delete_expired_users.py`` with instructions on
  how to use it as a cron job to clean up expired/inactive accounts.

* Marked strings for translation and added ``locale`` directory so
  that translations can be added.

* Updated to deal with merge of Django's Unicode branch into trunk;
  now using Unicode-aware functions everywhere.


Version 0.2, 29 May 2007:
-------------------------

Packaged from revision 76 in Subversion; download at
http://django-registration.googlecode.com/files/registration-0.2.tar.gz

* Added ability to specify a callback in
  ``RegistrationManager.create_inactive_user`` or in the ``register``
  view to enable creation of site-specific user profile.

* Separated out the logic of creating the profile into a new method on
  ``RegistrationManager``: ``create_profile``.

* Added URLConf support for various useful views in
  ``django.contrib.auth``.

* BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: removed the ``key_generated`` field
  from ``RegistrationProfile``; activation key expiration is now
  calculated based on the ``date_joined`` field in the ``User`` model.
  Drop the ``key_generated`` column from your database when upgrading
  from 0.1.

-------------------------

Packaged from revision 56 in Subversion; download at
http://django-registration.googlecode.com/files/registration-0.1.tar.gz
